<p>This solidity programs aims to create a smart contract and provides some basic functions to mint and burn the tokens and ther volume.
While in 5_Eth_avax one we have used 3 different way of handling error which is require ,assert and revert</p>

<h3> Description </h3>
<p>
  The contract is written in solidity. There are some variables provided with default values such as token name and abbreviation and two function one is for  minting and adding the value of the token and thus increasing the total supply variable another one is to burn the token total volume 
  We provided the mapping so that account have values mapped to it .And also used conditional statements to not burn the volume if the volume given in parameters are bigger than the total volume currently present.
